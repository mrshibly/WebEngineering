# Web Engineering

This repository contains assignments and lab tasks for the Web Engineering course, completed as part of my first-year university curriculum. The tasks focus on web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and related tools like Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Each task includes code, documentation, and instructions to demonstrate skills in building and styling webpages.
